A great gaming experience!

In our project we are implementing both RMI and Socket connection methods and GUI/CLI view.

FA that we want to implement:
  1) Loading from file (in our case a .txt) of maps with variable dimesion.
  2) Multiple game on the same server
  
We also implemented a sistem of LogIn with the persistance of data on the server.
